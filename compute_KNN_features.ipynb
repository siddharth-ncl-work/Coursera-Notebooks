In this homework we will extend KNN model and compute more features, based on nearest neighbors and their distances. \n","\n","You will need to implement a number of features, that were one of the key features, that leaded the instructors to prizes in [Otto](https://www.kaggle.com/c/otto-group-product-classification-challenge) and [Springleaf](https://www.kaggle.com/c/springleaf-marketing-response) competitions. Of course, the list of features you will need to implement can be extended, in fact in competitions the list was at least 3 times larger. So when solving a real competition do not hesitate to make up your own features.   \n","\n","You can optionally implement multicore feature computation. Nearest neighbours are hard to compute so it is preferable to have a parallel version of the algorithm. In fact, it is really a cool skill to know how to use `multiprocessing`, `joblib` and etc. In this homework you will have a chance to see the benefits of parallel algorithm.
